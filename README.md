<h1 align="center">License Generator</h1>

### Overview

This is a blazing fast âš¡, command line license generator for your open source projects written in Go.

I know that GitHub has a great GUI to add licenses to projects but I always found myself doing too much work. First, you have to go to GitHub, create a file, type 'LICENSE', pick a license, push it, and then pull it locally. With this, you can just generate the license locally and push it to GitHub.

### Usage

```bash
license-gen
```
